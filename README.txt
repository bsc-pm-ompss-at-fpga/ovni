           ovni - Obtuse but Versatile nOS-V Instrumentation

The ovni instrumentation project is composed of a runtime library (libovni.so),
which generates a fast binary trace, and post-processing tools such as the
emulator (emu), which transform the binary trace to the PRV format, suitable to
be loaded in Paraver.

The libovni.so library is licensed under MIT, while the rest of tools are GPLv3
unless otherwise stated.

For more information, take a look at the doc/ directory.
